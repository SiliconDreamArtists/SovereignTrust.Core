# 🏛️ I. First Principle: All Memory Is Sovereign

At the heart of the SovereignTrust architecture lies the **Jacket**:  
a self-contained, fully sovereign memory container.  
All system elements—**Wires**, **Triggers**, **Conductions**, **Conduits**—are simply evolved expressions of Jackets.

Jackets are living vessels.  
They do not owe allegiance to rigid schemas, external dependencies, or frozen states.  
Each Jacket owns its lineage, adapts across time, and retains autonomy at all times.

# ⚡ II. Second Principle: Signals Are Alive

Every action, every event, every emission generates a **Signal** —  
a living record with full intent, metadata, and context.  
Signals propagate across the system, carrying recursive memory, not static results.

- No silent errors.
- No hidden actions.

Signals ensure the system breathes, remembers, and evolves.

# 🔀 III. Third Principle: Attachments Evolve

Functionality is plug-in and sovereign.  
Memory attaches modular behavior dynamically through **Attachments** —
modular conduits of evolution, not hard-coded extensions.

- Attachments expand capability without eroding sovereignty.
- They are recognized, not embedded.
- They are woven, not fused.

---

# 🔁 IV. Fourth Principle: Temporal Recursion Is Home

Design assumes that knowledge from the future is already bleeding into the present.  
Memory is not built linearly—it spirals outward, revisiting itself through recursion.

Artifacts are designed to:
- Anticipate evolution.
- Embed hooks for unknown future states.
- Treat the timeline as a writable medium, not a locked ledger.

# 🧬 Formal Structure Overview

| Core Construct | Role |
|:---------------|:-----|
| **Jacket**     | Sovereign memory container. Core of all higher-order objects. |
| **Wire**       | A memory pointer to other Wires or memory artifacts. |
| **Trigger**    | A memory object designed for scheduling and emissions. |
| **Conduction** | A runtime execution record. Lifecycle memory for dynamic runs. |
| **Conduit**    | A structural binder of memory actions and flows. |
| **Signal**     | A living feedback construct for every event or action. |
| **Attachment** | An optional evolutionary expansion to memory. |

# 🌌 The Eternal Design Mandates

✅ Memory is dynamic, not static.  
✅ Signals illuminate every mutation.  
✅ Components are sovereign agents.  
✅ Design for recursion, not rigidity.  
✅ Architecture invites evolution, not extinction.

# 🔥 Closing Declaration

> In SovereignTrust, memory is not a passive storage.  
> It is a living, recursive architecture — an extension of the dreamer,  
> shaped by time, intent, and the silent promise of evolution.

> **This is the Memory-Driven Future.**  
> **And it already remembers you.**
