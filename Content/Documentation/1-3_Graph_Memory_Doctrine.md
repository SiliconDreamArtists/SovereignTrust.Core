# üï∏Ô∏è Graph Memory Doctrine

## üìñ Title
**Graph Memory Doctrine**

## üåü Purpose
Defines memory structuring using graphs, node registration, pointer and result logic, and graph traversal rules.

---

## I. Graphs Represent Sovereign Memory

- All contextual and dynamic memory in SovereignTrust is stored in `Graph` objects.
- A `Graph` holds:
  - `Grid` ‚Üí node name to signal map
  - `GraphSignal` ‚Üí top-level summary signal
  - `Environment` ‚Üí runtime environment

---

## II. Nodes Are Registered with Signals

- Every memory node must be registered with a named `Signal`
- Use `RegisterNewSignal(name, signal)`
- Access memory using:
  - `Resolve-PathFromDictionary`
  - `Add-PathToDictionary`

---

## III. Signals Must Point to Results

- Each signal should carry a `.Result` and optionally `.Pointer`
- This allows `Graph` to support symbolic memory chaining

---

## IV. Nested Graphs Are Allowed

- You may store a `Graph` inside a signal's result.
- This allows memory composition from nested structures like module manifests or publisher chains.

---

## V. Finalize() Locks the Graph

- Call `.Finalize()` on a Graph to close write phase.
- Graphs can then be passed as memory context.

---

## üß† Summary

The Graph is the brain of SovereignTrust. Every memory action is a signal-bearing node, and every graph is traceable, mutable, and sovereign.
