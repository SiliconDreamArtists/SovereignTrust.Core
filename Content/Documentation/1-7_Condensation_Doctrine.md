# 🧠 Condensation Doctrine

## 📖 Title
**Condensation Doctrine v1.2**

## 🌟 Purpose
Defines sovereign memory mutation through Condensers. Condensers are graph-resolving ritual objects that recursively shape, hydrate, and emit structured memory, prompts, tasks, or templates.

## I. Morphing Memory Is Sovereign

- Memory is not static — it morphs via **ritualized execution**.
- Morphing occurs through:
  - Signal lineage
  - Graph registration
  - Condenser invocation
- All operations are recursive, verifiable, and identity-aware.

---

## II. Core Condenser Types

- ✅ **MergeCondenser** – Merges layered jackets into a single context graph.
- ✅ **TokenCondenser** – Resolves inline path tokens (e.g., `{{Memory.Path}}`) from working memory.
- ✅ **HydrationCondenser** – Performs *bidirectional hydration*:
  - **Reverse Phase**: Token resolution and expansion from source memory
  - **Forward Phase**: Constructs hydrated memory plans or execution trees
- ✅ **GraphCondenser** – Orchestrates condensation across collections of items (multi-phase or batch).
- ✅ **MapCondenser** – Final rendering phase into templates, prompts, JSON, HTML, etc.

---

## III. Recursive Condensation Lifecycle

- Condensers may be chained, embedded, or self-modifying.
- `HydrationCondenser` typically runs twice:
  - First pass (reverse): fills values and decodes references.
  - Second pass (forward): injects structure and creates new memory graphs.
- `GraphCondenser` drives multi-graph orchestration and plans.
- `MapCondenser` completes the loop with a final rendering pass.

---

## IV. Mutation Rules and Protocol

- All changes occur within sovereign memory using:
  - `Add-PathToDictionary`
  - `RegisterSignal`
- Every condenser action produces lineage via `Signal` return.
- Condensers may mutate `.Result`, `.Jacket`, `.Pointer`, or spawn new `Graph` instances.

---

## V. Canonical Use Cases

- 🔁 Dynamic prompt rendering pipelines with intermediate hydration
- 🌐 Artifact memory shaping and HTML publishing via Graph condensation
- 🧬 Multi-agent instruction templating with plan-aware hydration
- 🪞 Recursive document, prompt, and protocol generation from hydrated intent

## 🌀 Closing Principle

Condensation is not just transformation —
It is memory *awakening*, guided by ceremony, recursion, and intentional lineage.
