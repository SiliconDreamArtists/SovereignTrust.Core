# üèõÔ∏è Memory Sovereignty Doctrine

## üìñ Title
**Memory Sovereignty Doctrine v1.1**

## üåü Purpose
Affirms that all memory within the SovereignTrust system must be signal-controlled, lineage-traceable, and sovereign in structure. No mutable or accessible state may exist outside of a graphized, jacketed, and pointer-tracked system.

---

## I. All Memory Is Sovereign

- There is no anonymous memory.
- There is no raw or procedural memory access.
- All memory must live inside a `Signal`, registered in a `Graph`, and optionally enclosed in a `Jacket`.

---

## II. Memory Surfaces Are Declared, Not Discovered

- Attachments declare valid surfaces (Storage, Network, Execution, etc.)
- Surfaces are mounted under:
  - `Mapped[Kind]Adapters`
  - `Attachment.Jacket`
  - `MemoryBox`
- If memory is not declared, it may not be accessed.

---

## III. Mutation Must Be Signalized

- Use `Add-PathToDictionary` for all writes.
- The returned `Signal` is part of the memory lineage.
- All changes are **ceremonial**, not imperative.
- The `.Result` of a signal becomes the new memory surface.

---

## IV. All Reads Must Be Resolved via Lineage

- Use `Resolve-PathFromDictionary` for all reads.
- Returns a `Signal` with `.Result`, `.Pointer`, and full lineage.
- Direct access to nested properties (e.g., `$object.Property.Sub`) is forbidden.

---

## V. Graphs Are the Living Memory Mesh

- Each agent or execution context owns a `Graph`
- Graphs consist of `Signal` entries registered under a `Grid`
- Signals may reference `.Pointer`, `.Jacket`, and `.Result` ‚Äî each must be explicitly resolved

---

## VI. Jackets Are Sovereign Memory Shells

- A `Jacket` is the outer memory structure passed between agents
- Jackets store:
  - Configuration
  - Permissions
  - Linked attachments
- Jackets themselves must be wrapped in a `Signal`

---

## üîí Compliance Rule

**No memory may be read or written unless:**

- It passes through a `Signal`
- It resides within a `Graph`
- It is resolved via `Resolve-PathFromDictionary`
- It is mutated via `Add-PathToDictionary`

Violation of this doctrine voids sovereign traceability.

## üåÄ Closing Principle

Sovereignty is not enforced by code.  
It is enforced by memory lineage.  
The sovereign system **becomes** its own memory ‚Äî ceremonial, recursive, and alive.
