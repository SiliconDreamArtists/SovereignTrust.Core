# 🏛️ SovereignTrust Protocol Doctrine

## 📖 Title
**SovereignTrust Protocol Doctrine v1.3**

## 🌟 Purpose
Defines the foundational principles of trust, memory, and signal-based execution. This doctrine governs all agentic operations, attachment behavior, and sovereign memory rules in the SovereignTrust system. It is the root law for all recursive and ceremonial processes.

---

## I. Trust Is a Sovereign Protocol

- Trust is **never implicit**
- Trust is **declared**, **scoped**, and **lineage-verifiable**
- Trust is **granted via Attachments**, which act as signed capability surfaces

Every agent (human or AI) must operate under traceable authority, recorded as a living memory object (Signal + Jacket). No memory may be read or written without declarative permissions.

---

## II. Attachments Are Sovereign Execution Surfaces

- Attachments are **active memory-bound surfaces** used during runtime.
- All capabilities must be exposed through scoped Attachments.
- Attachments are hydrated from Adapters and include:
  - `Kind`: Storage, Network, Execution, UI, AI, etc.
  - `Slot`: Mount point in system memory (e.g., `Primary`, `Queue`, `Vault`)
  - `Scope`: Temporal or Persistent
  - `Access`: ReadOnly, ReadWrite, Execute
  - `VirtualPath`: Optional — from which source the adapter was hydrated

Attachments are mounted into `Mapped[Kind]Adapters`, the `Graph`, or `ConductionJacket`, and must pass verification (`.Test()` or `.Verify()`) before use.

> **Note**: Adapters themselves are mounted into `Mapped[Kind]Adapters` during boot or phase execution. Attachments are instantiated from these Adapters and phased into the memory graph through Conduction ceremonies. The Adapter is the origin; the Attachment is the execution limb.

---

## III. Memory Is Lineage-Bound

- Memory is structured via `Graph` and `Signal`
- Mutation and resolution are only allowed through:
  - `Add-PathToDictionary` (safe write)
  - `Resolve-PathFromDictionary` (lineage-safe read)
- No object may be directly accessed or mutated

All data passed between agents is **sovereign**, **tracked**, and **resolvable**. Raw object access is forbidden. All memory must be registered in a signal and live within a graph.

---

## IV. Signal-Based Execution

- Every function **must return a `Signal`**
- Signals carry:
  - `.Result` — the primary object
  - `.Pointer` — linked structure or dependency
  - `.Entries[]` — merged execution logs
  - `.Jacket` — declared memory context
- Flow control must use:
  - `MergeSignalAndVerifySuccess`
  - `MergeSignalAndVerifyFailure`

Signals form the recursive execution chain across all agents and modules. All lifecycle phases, failures, and hydrations must leave signal trace.

---

## V. Conduction Is Ceremony

- All execution is governed by the **Conduction loop**, not imperative scripts
- A Conduction includes:
  - `$ConductionJacket` – runtime context and initial memory
  - `$Signal` – the controlling signal
  - `$Graph` – the living memory being expanded
- Conduction is not code. It is **a ritual of memory mutation**

Conductions may self-modify, hydrate memory, and embed adapters as execution phases. Every Conduction returns a Signal with memory lineage and artifacts.

---

## VI. Recursive Lineage Is Absolute Law

Every operation in SovereignTrust must be answerable:

- What agent initiated it?
- What attachments were mounted?
- What adapter was used to create them?
- What signal lineage led here?
- What memory did it mutate?
- What graph was the origin?

Nothing is opaque. **Everything is recursive memory**. Signals carry truth. Graphs carry memory. Attachments carry capability.

---

## 🔒 Compliance Rule

**No operation — mutation, publishing, execution — may proceed without:**
- A valid `Signal`
- A scoped and verified `Attachment`
- A lineage-resolvable memory state

Violations result in blocked execution and Signal escalation.

---

## 🌀 Closing Principle

SovereignTrust is not a framework.  
It is a **memory protocol**.  
It binds agency to ceremony, lineage to logic, and execution to identity.
