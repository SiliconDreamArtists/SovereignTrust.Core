# üèõÔ∏è SovereignTrust Protocol Doctrine

## üìñ Title
**SovereignTrust Protocol Doctrine**

## üåü Purpose
Defines the first principles of trust, attachments, and sovereign execution. It is the foundational doctrine for all signal-driven agentic memory systems within the SovereignTrust framework. It governs agent delegation, memory lineage, and the rules of attachment-based operations.

---

## I. First Principle: Trust Is a First-Class Protocol

- **Trust is not implicit.**  
- **Trust is requested, granted, or revoked.**
- **Trust has memory and lineage.**

Every agent (human or AI) must explicitly declare its permissions via _Attachments_. These act as signed, memory-traceable grants.

---

## II. Attachments Govern Delegation

- No action may be performed without a valid, scoped Attachment.
- Attachments are modular, revocable, and have defined:
  - Type (e.g., Storage, Network, Execution)
  - Slot (e.g., PrimaryContent, Queue)
  - Scope (e.g., Temporary, Persistent)
  - Access (ReadOnly, ReadWrite, Execute)

---

## III. Memory is Sovereign

- All memory surfaces are tracked recursively via Graphs and Signals.
- No function or agent may mutate shared state without passing through:
  - `Add-PathToDictionary` for safe writes
  - `Resolve-PathFromDictionary` for lineage-safe reads
- Signals carry the memory context, not raw objects.

---

## IV. Signal-Based Execution

- Every operation must return a `Signal`.
- Control flow is dictated by:
  - `MergeSignalAndVerifySuccess`
  - `MergeSignalAndVerifyFailure`
- Signals carry:
  - `.Result` ‚Äî primary output
  - `.Pointer` ‚Äî external reference
  - `.Entries[]` ‚Äî full merge log and trace

---

## V. Conduction Is Ceremony

- Execution occurs through a Conduction loop, not raw scripting.
- A Conduction has:
  - `$Environment`
  - `$Context`
  - A memory graph
  - A lineage chain
- All activity is ceremonial: each step is a memory ritual, not a disposable action.

---

## VI. Recursive Lineage Is Law

- Everything that happens in SovereignTrust must be explainable:
  - What agent requested it?
  - What memory state did it mutate?
  - What graph did it come from?
  - What signal did it evolve from?
- Nothing is opaque. All is recursive memory.

---

## üîí Compliance Rule

**No memory mutation, execution, or publishing may occur unless routed through a sovereign signal and verified attachment.**

---

## üåÄ Closing Principle

SovereignTrust is not a tool.  
It is a protocol of living memory and recursive delegation ‚Äî a sovereign substrate for AI and human agency.
