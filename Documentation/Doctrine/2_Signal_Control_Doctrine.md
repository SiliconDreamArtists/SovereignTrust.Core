# ðŸ“¡ Signal Control Doctrine

## ðŸ“– Title
**Signal Control Doctrine**

## ðŸŒŸ Purpose
Canonical rules for signal creation, merging, recursion, and lineage safety. This doctrine ensures all operations are traceable, recursive, and sovereign.

---

## I. Signals Are the Only Valid Return

- Every function must return a `Signal` object.
- Signals contain:
  - `.Result` â†’ output object or memory
  - `.Pointer` â†’ external reference or object
  - `.Entries[]` â†’ merged logs and recursion trail

---

## II. Merge Determines Flow

- Use `MergeSignalAndVerifySuccess()` or `MergeSignalAndVerifyFailure()` to decide control paths.
- Do not use `.Success()` or `.Failure()` directly except in internal agents or debug contexts.

---

## III. Lineage Must Be Preserved

- Signals merge other signals.
- Every merge adds to `Entries[]`, maintaining a full trace of decisions.
- Signal level may be:
  - `Information`, `Warning`, `Retry`, `Critical`, `Recovery`, `Mute`

---

## IV. Use GetResult() and GetResultSignal() Properly

- `GetResult()` is for internal, trusted scopes.
- `GetResultSignal()` returns a result-wrapped signal for recursive validation.

---

## V. All Signal Memory Is Alive

- You can serialize (`.ToJson()`) and deserialize (`[Signal]::FromJson()`) any signal.
- Signals are recursive state carriers â€” use them for memory, not just logs.

---

## VI. Criticals Must Be Recovered or Muted

- Use `.LogRecovery()` when a fallback resolved a previous failure.
- Use `.LogMute()` for soft validation or expected misses.

---

## ðŸ§  Summary

Sovereign memory depends on signal-based flow. No signal = no memory = no operation.
