# 🏛️ Execution Layer Doctrine

## 📖 Title
**Execution Layer Doctrine**

## 🌟 Purpose
Secure, modular rules for how Executors, Routers, and Queues run recursive tasks and publish results in the SovereignTrust system.

---

## I. Execution is Memory-Bound

- All execution is triggered by a `Signal`.
- Execution surfaces are loaded from declared `Attachments`.
- Results must mutate memory through Conduction-based flow.

---

## II. Executors Are Controlled Agents

- Each `Executor` class must:
  - Accept a Conduction context.
  - Run inside a `Signal` loop.
  - Write output into Graph memory.

---

## III. Routing is Lineage-Aware

- Routers determine which Conduction Plan to invoke.
- They inspect the signal for:
  - Origin
  - Agent
  - Role
  - Phase

---

## IV. Queue Systems are Sovereign Relays

- No Signal is passed "as-is".
- All queued signals are relayed through a secured Gate.
- Queues must:
  - Be mapped as `MappedNetworkAttachment`
  - Poll on interval
  - Pass through the `Router` for execution

---

## 🔒 Compliance Rule

**Do not allow any signal to invoke an Executor unless it has passed through:
a Router → Gate → Queue → Conduction.**

---

## 🌀 Closing Principle

Execution is not a call. It is a ritual. Only sovereign signals may run.
