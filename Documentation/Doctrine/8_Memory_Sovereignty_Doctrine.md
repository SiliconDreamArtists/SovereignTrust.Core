# 🏛️ Memory Sovereignty Doctrine

## 📖 Title
**Memory Sovereignty Doctrine**

## 🌟 Purpose
Establishes that all memory access must be signal-controlled, recursive, traceable, and sovereign. No mutable state exists outside of the lineage-aware Graph and Signal system.

---

## I. All Memory is Sovereign

- There is no global state.
- There is no anonymous memory.
- All memory must be accessible via a `Graph` object and registered via a `Signal`.

---

## II. Memory Surfaces Must Be Declarative

- Attachments declare memory surfaces (Storage, Network, Execution).
- Memory access is only valid if resolved from:
  - `MemoryBox`
  - `Attachment`
  - `Mapped{Kind}Attachments`

---

## III. Mutation Must Be Ritualized

- Use `Add-PathToDictionary` for all memory writes.
- Each write must return a `Signal` that is merged into the active context.
- Writes are not procedural — they are ceremonial.

---

## IV. Reads Must Be Traceable

- Use `Resolve-PathFromDictionary` for memory reads.
- The returned `Signal` tracks the memory lineage of the read.
- No read may bypass the graph.

---

## V. Graphs Govern the Living Memory

- Every agent, project, or Conduction has a Graph.
- Graphs contain `SignalGrid` dictionaries.
- All interaction is done via `Signal` resolution — not raw object traversal.

---

## 🔒 Compliance Rule

**You may not access `.property` directly from any nested structure.
Use graph resolution and signal memory access only.**

---

## 🌀 Closing Principle

A sovereign system does not observe memory — it becomes memory.
