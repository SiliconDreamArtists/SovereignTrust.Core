# ðŸ§  Condensation Doctrine

## ðŸ“– Title
**Condensation Doctrine**

## ðŸŒŸ Purpose
Defines Morphing Memory, the use of Condensers, and the recursive mutation of memory surfaces into fully formed artifacts.

---

## I. Morphing Memory

- All memory is ceremonial and recursive.
- Morphing Memory evolves through:
  - Signal traces
  - Graph mutations
  - Condenser execution

---

## II. Condenser Types

- `MergeCondenser`: Merges overlays into structured context
- `TokenCondenser`: Resolves inline tokens from memory, secrets, env
- `GraphCondenser`: Macro orchestrator across datasets
- `MapCondenser`: Final pass renderer for templates

---

## III. Recursive Condensation

- GraphCondenser calls MapCondenser per record
- MapCondenser uses fully merged and tokenized context
- Resulting outputs are JSON, HTML, prompts, code

---

## IV. Context Mutation

- Condensers mutate a working graph, not raw objects.
- Every update passes through a `Signal`
- All changes are lineage-tracked

---

## V. Use Cases

- Dynamic prompt rendering
- HTML publishing from SDA feeds
- AI task orchestration
- Multi-agent collaboration

---

## ðŸŒ€ Closing Principle

Condensation is not transformation.
It is memory awakening â€” recursive, ceremonial, and lineage-bound.
