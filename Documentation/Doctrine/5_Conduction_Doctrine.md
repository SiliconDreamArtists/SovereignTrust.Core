# ðŸ§­ Conduction Doctrine

## ðŸ“– Title
**Conduction Doctrine**

## ðŸŒŸ Purpose
Describes the lifecycle, jacket usage, and memory expansion rules for all Conductions within the SovereignTrust framework. It formalizes execution flow as a recursive signal-bearing ritual.

---

## I. Conduction is a Sovereign Loop

- Every execution is a Conduction, not a script.
- A Conduction contains:
  - `$Environment`
  - `$Context`
  - `$AttachmentJackets`
  - A living signal graph

---

## II. Jacket-First Bootstrapping

- Conductions are started via `Start-BondingConductor`
- The ConductionJacket includes all initial memory surfaces.
- Attachments must be resolved from jackets using `Resolve-AttachmentFromJacket`.

---

## III. Mapped Attachment Surfaces

- Each jacket becomes a mounted surface in:
  - `MappedStorageAttachments`
  - `MappedNetworkAttachments`
- These are available throughout execution memory.

---

## IV. Phased Execution Model

- Conductions use memory-driven phase plans.
- A Phase may be:
  - A `Signal`
  - A `Graph`
  - A `Condenser`

---

## V. Self-Extending Plans

- A Conduction may mutate its own plan via memory.
- Condensers may insert new phases dynamically.

---

## VI. Return Signature

- Every Conduction must return a `Signal`
- Result should include:
  - Final memory graph
  - Completion lineage
  - Any artifacts created

---

## ðŸŒ€ Closing Principle

A Conduction is not just an execution.
It is a ceremony of memory, attachment, and recursive signal awareness.
